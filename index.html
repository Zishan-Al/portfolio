            </div>
            <div class="about-content" data-scroll data-scroll-speed="1">
                 <p>With over six years of diverse professional experience, my journey has been driven by a passion for leveraging technology to solve problems and improve efficiency â€“ a passion that I am now keen to focus on the educational and ed-tech landscape. My background in operations management, client implementation, digital marketing, and technical support has equipped me with a versatile skill set that I believe can significantly contribute to the growth and innovation within educational institutions and technology-driven learning platforms.</p>
                <p>Throughout my career, I've consistently sought opportunities to optimize processes and implement effective technical solutions. As a <strong><a href="#ascanius-exp" data-scroll-to>Director and CEO at Ascanius</a></strong>, I led strategic direction and client engagement, honing my skills in understanding client needs and delivering tailored solutions. My experience in client onboarding, particularly with platforms like <strong><a href="#ascanius-exp" data-scroll-to>GoHighLevel</a></strong>, has provided me with a strong foundation in ensuring smooth user adoption of new technologies.</p>
                <p>My interest in education is further underscored by my <strong><a href="#void-exp" data-scroll-to>Google Workspace for Education certifications</a></strong>. Beyond professional roles, I have a strong commitment to fostering learning. For over six years, I volunteered as a certified mentor for international robotics competitions like <strong><a href="#mentor-exp" data-scroll-to>FIRST Tech Challenge</a></strong>, mentoring students on programming, design, and critical thinking. This has provided me with invaluable insights into the learning process and the importance of engaging students through hands-on activities.</p>
